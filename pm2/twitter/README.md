This project uses Flutter and the Dart programming language for UI programming.

The UI architecture of choice is Model, View, View-Model (MVVM) using the BLoC pattern for such implementation.

The BLoC pattern (Business Logic Component) in Flutter uses MVVM to separate events and states to make UIs more flexible and testable.
