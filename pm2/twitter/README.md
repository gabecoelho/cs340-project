This project uses Flutter and the Dart programming language for UI programming.

The UI architecture of choice is Model,View, View-Model (MVVM) using the BLoC pattern for such implementation.

The BLoC pattern in Flutter uses MVVM to separate events and states to make UIs more flexible and testable.
